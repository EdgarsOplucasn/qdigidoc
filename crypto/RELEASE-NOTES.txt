--------------------------------------
Changes compared to ver 3.8

	- Added warning message that is displayed if the software version check has not succeeded after 7 or more consecutive days. Added possibility to prevent the message from appearing consecutively.

	- Added restriction so that the software cannot be used if the Kill Switch has been executed. Information in a pop-up window about required update of the software is displayed, the DigiDoc3 Crypto window is closed after the user clicks OK and the current software version cannot be used.
